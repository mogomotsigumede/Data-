	<H2 style="text-align:center;"> # Welcome To HTML Tutorial # </H2>
		<P1 style="text-align:center;"> This will guide you to the easy step of learning HTML Through private lesson it is FREE. </P1>
		<li>Use Google </li>
		<li> Use more resource</li>
		<li> Softwares like it</li>
		<P2 style="text-align:center;">> In order to learn you have to believe. Lets BEGIN.....</P2> 
		<P3 style="text-align:center;"> A lot more about this is that a family content edition will be made for you. Just choice want PRODUCT you want. 
		Just click on the video to learn more about type in the right mind when using HTML. </P3>

		<H3 style="text-align:center;">  NEXT...  </H3>
		Is going to be a document that makes this challenge a lot easier. 
		The best thing about using HTML is the fact that you can give back to other people.
		 That will not be able to recieve such help. 
		For instance if you control the SOURCE CODE given to you in one of the lesson in the document. Above it will make things easier. 
		What I have learned is to use what have been given to you. ensure that it is converted merely to the interne (GOOGLE) . Or other search engine. 
		Seeing a Good video will make it clearer to program in HTML.

			The internet provider should be available to get you a connection. Through NOTEPAD. 
			you such win at designing webpage you desire. 
			Always use example from the INTERNET. I will guide you to the rest of this. 

			Going on the internet is NOT HARD but just make sure that you can get there safely, with a secure,
			 Installing Macifee will be the best security in this place.It will provide a lot of helpful
		</p2> 
		<P1 style="text-align:center;"> 
			Navigating to websites has become a lot cheaper and smarter. you will need other gadgets to make it faster, so that it runs with incredile spread. 
			The internet was desing to bring together people from all other the world as a way to communicate inspite the reach. 
			Lets say if I was located in London but had to call someone, I can't so I will us the internet, 
			powered by the smarts satelit system to guide my signal to a new place in New England Australia.
			 I have language that NASA release satelites to SPACE. 
			 to send even powerful signal much like a power plant sends millions of volts to a transformer. But instead its in a deep UNKNOWN.  
			WHY? because I have to talk to someone COUNTRY I don't understand. </P1>

			<h3 style="text-align:center;"> Continuing ON. </h3>
		<P2 style="text-align:center;"> 
			The Speed of LIGHT is involved however listen closely...., It is the satelites reflective ARMS that develops 			transfers it too NEW ENGLAND.
			 But the AUZies are just as HARD to understand as the Scots.
			 Not to Dethrone the WILD, 
			Its merely my love to send a please don't buy the BOUNTY chocolates from the SNOKIE SHOP in my 		underpants. </P2>
		<p3 style="text-align:center;">
			There is too much to learn about this course I will have you to sit down and relax and enough a cup of warm coffee either in Starbucks or Cafe Nero. So to speak, 
`			Begining at the start it using notepad and send mass amount of html command, you can create so many 			different website that can stand out from others. Behold youtube and its many features, and a wedding 			  expo that can have many pictures of loved one taking part etc.

		<p4 style="text-align:center;">
			You can create a search like BING and bing image to store other poeple images. That is what I mogomotsi will create. Just make sure its not digusting to see. Everyone likes clear high res, picture. Dont worry, its only fair. 
		<H3 style="text-align:center;" > Moreover </H3> 
			You can even a cooking website. I also suggest W3 school that will make programming easy and 	straight forward. If I had created notepad I would have made it this way, which is to open and convert the data there to Internet and Chrome or Firefox. Nothing upset the stomach like working too hard O can not understand that if you have a problem you must start deleting some of  the unnessary work that will be to complicated to understand. But like a well educated programmer in the net you should engage all areas of it power edgy hands that fetch information at the speed of light Yes I do go on about it but that just the thing. How can a human life on earth in a busy street ad have no information at the tip pf your hand. Please read on. Spotify gives up of it scientific understanding on light. It merely uses Sound on the internet I would say en element to unrare and uncommon to the human ear. Stream music from across the world at the rate of 10 beats per second. Music such as QUEEN, TCHAISOVSKY,JAMES BROWN, JOYOUS  CELEBRATION, IRON MAIDEN and MY MORNING JACKET. I'm not a fan of James brown but merely a fan of  joyous celebration. It jsut expressing my love of internet products 
			<H3 style="text-align:center;"> Finally  </H3>
			Its simple I am going to create helpful Bet countdown that will end on a certain time. If not I will report on anything else or the ability to hack other sites just to boost my. JOKING. 
			I am glad that a internet connection. To boost the productivity I would again suggest more people to work on this with instuctions. You Must leave everything and just focus all you effects on HTML to be an legendary programer.
